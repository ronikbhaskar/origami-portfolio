Ronik Bhaskar is a Chicago-based origami artist who uses paper folding as a way to tell stories. Rather than focusing solely on technical complexity or realism, his work is built around ideas. Each piece starts with a concept, theme, or narrative he wants to communicate.

Working from a single sheet of paper, Ronik designs original models that explore humor, metaphor, and everyday experiences. A finished piece might combine multiple elements in a single composition or reinterpret a familiar object in an unexpected way. The goal is to tell a story beyond the recognizable form.

Constraints are central to his process. Great stories are told not just in the details they include, but the ones they exclude. By limiting his work to folded, uncut squares, Ronik finds the essential components to tell his stories. Through his work, Ronik approaches origami not just as a craft, but as a medium for visual storytelling, one sheet of paper at a time.
