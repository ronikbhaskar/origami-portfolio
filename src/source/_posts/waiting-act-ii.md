*Waiting* tells a story in two parts. In this second part, a family of ducks is waiting by a bench,. The [first act](../waiting-act-i) reveals whom the ducks are waiting for: a person. 

Both designs incorporate identical benches. The goal here was to use the repeatability of origami to create a bench that was so similar in both settings, the viewer would be forgiven for thinking it was the same bench. In fact, neither the person nor the ducks can be detached from the bench. Both works are from single squares of paper.

There are multiple ways to interpret these works, whether from the lens of reduced conservationism, deprioritizing the outdoors, or being in the right place at the wrong time.
