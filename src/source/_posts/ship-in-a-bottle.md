I have been holding onto this idea for over a year now. I saw someone put a paper boat in a plastic bottle as a way to do an origami ship in a bottle, but I thought it could be done better. The bottle and ship should be from the same sheet, and the paper should be opaque. 

This is one of my most recognizable subjects, despite the fact that it's not even a full bottle. If anyone ever asks how storytelling feeds into my origami, I always point to this, because so much of storytelling is finding exactly which details are necessary to communicate an idea. 

This was my qualifier round entry for the 2025 Death Battle Design Contest.
