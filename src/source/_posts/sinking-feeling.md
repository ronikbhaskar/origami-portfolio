This work is loosely in series with [Sky's the Limit](../skys-the-limit). Meta origami tends to focus on cranes or flat sheets, but there are so many recognizable forms in origami, like the paper boat. Here, I have a sailor in a (sinking) ship. 

The paper boat is an interesting form, because it's the standard for both boats and sailor's hats in origami, so I made a design with both. The title is also a double entendre for the folding sequence, which uses a lot of sink folds.
