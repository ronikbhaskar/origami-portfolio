Phishing is a cyberattack that baits people, usually through malicious emails or messages. The term comes from the hacking community as a play on "fishing," a hunting method that also tends to use baiting.

It's a strange analogy, because we're essentially equating victims with fish, because humans bait fish. In an effort to subvert the phrase, I decided to look at a fish that baits humans, and there's no better example than the mythological siren. Sirens would lure sailors to their death, and for centuries, many believed them to be real. 

To combine the two, I made a siren, except rather than have it sing, I gave it a baseball cap, a t-shirt, and a fishing pole with an email at the end. Rather than luring sailors, the siren is phishing in the digital ocean.

This was my quarterfinals entry for the 2025 Death Battle Design Contest.
