Hanging by a thread typically implies desperately clinging to something. I wanted to consider the perspective where you have given up, and there's something else putting the effort into holding you up. In this case, the subject is being held up by a balloon, but they are, for lack of a better term, done with everything. To some degree, I was inspired by Banksy's "Girl with Balloon", which inspired my color choice.

This model won the July 2024 Origami-Dan Design Contest.
