*Waiting* tells a story in two parts. In this first part, someone is waiting on a bench, holding a paper boat. The [second act](../waiting-act-ii) reveals whom the subject is waiting for: a family of ducks. 

Both designs incorporate identical benches. The goal here was to use the repeatability of origami to create a bench that was so similar in both settings, the viewer would be forgiven for thinking it was the same bench. In fact, neither the person nor the ducks can be detached from the bench. Both works are from single squares of paper.

There are multiple ways to interpret these works, whether from the lens of reduced conservationism, deprioritizing the outdoors, or being in the right place at the wrong time.
