This work is loosely in series with [Sinking Feeling](../sinking-feeling). Meta origami tends to focus on cranes or flat sheets, but there are so many recognizable forms in origami, like the paper plane. Here, I have a pilot with a scarf flying a paper plane. 

I folded a lot of paper planes as a kid, so I think I would have been excited to know that I could not only design a plane with a pilot, but it actually flies.

I should really refold this and take a better photo. The whole thing was rushed because I was trying to force myself back into designing after an 8 month hiatus.
