We are the universe observing itself.

Origami is the perfect medium for this idea, because both the observer and the universe can be made from the same sheet, completely connected. Here, the observer is the telescope, and the universe is the night sky with a single star visible. The telescope is modeled after my own personal telescope, so I had a lot of fun combining a separate passion of mine with origami.
