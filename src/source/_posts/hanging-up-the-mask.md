Comedy never looked so tragic. Whether out of fear or necessity, people often hide themselves behind a mask. I wanted to show how people might feel behind the mask without showing the actual face. To do this, I focused on taking the happiest mask in theater—the comedy mask—and give it a somber context. 

To show the mask taken off, I show it held at the corner loosely by a hand. The ribbons are untied and dangling. The smiling face shows deep shadows over the eyes and mouth.

This was my Round of 32 entry for the 2025 Death Battle Design Contest.
