    <title>Fish out of Water</title>
    <url>/fish-out-of-water/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>A bit of an absurdist take on the phrase. Being a fish out of water tends to be a bad thing, but I wanted to put a positive spin on the idea. Origami fish typically aren’t in water to begin with, so to make that part extra clear, I gave it an umbrella.</p>

    <title>Hanging by a Thread</title>
    <url>/hanging-by-a-thread/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Hanging by a thread typically implies desperately clinging to something. I wanted to consider the perspective where you have given up, and there’s something else putting the effort into holding you up. In this case, the subject is being held up by a balloon, but they are, for lack of a better term, done with everything. To some degree, I was inspired by Banksy’s “Girl with Balloon”, which inspired my color choice.</p>
<p>This model won the July 2024 Origami-Dan Design Contest.</p>

    <title>Hanging up the Mask</title>
    <url>/hanging-up-the-mask/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Comedy never looked so tragic. Whether out of fear or necessity, people often hide themselves behind a mask. I wanted to show how people might feel behind the mask without showing the actual face. To do this, I focused on taking the happiest mask in theater—the comedy mask—and give it a somber context. </p>
<p>To show the mask taken off, I show it held at the corner loosely by a hand. The ribbons are untied and dangling. The smiling face shows deep shadows over the eyes and mouth.</p>
<p>This was my Round of 32 entry for the 2025 Death Battle Design Contest. </p>

    <title>Phishing</title>
    <url>/phishing/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Phishing is a cyberattack that baits people, usually through malicious emails or messages. The term comes from the hacking community as a play on “fishing,” a hunting method that also tends to use baiting.</p>
<p>It’s a strange analogy, because we’re essentially equating victims with fish, because humans bait fish. In an effort to subvert the phrase, I decided to look at a fish that baits humans, and there’s no better example than the mythological siren. Sirens would lure sailors to their death, and for centuries, many believed them to be real. </p>
<p>To combine the two, I made a siren, except rather than have it sing, I gave it a baseball cap, a t-shirt, and a fishing pole with an email at the end. Rather than luring sailors, the siren is phishing in the digital ocean.</p>
<p>This was my quarterfinals entry for the 2025 Death Battle Design Contest. </p>

    <title>Sinking Feeling</title>
    <url>/sinking-feeling/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This work is loosely in series with <a href="../skys-the-limit">Sky’s the Limit</a>. Meta origami tends to focus on cranes or flat sheets, but there are so many recognizable forms in origami, like the paper boat. Here, I have a sailor in a (sinking) ship. </p>
<p>The paper boat is an interesting form, because it’s the standard for both boats and sailor’s hats in origami, so I made a design with both. The title is also a double entendre for the folding sequence, which uses a lot of sink folds.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>This work is loosely in series with <a href="../sinking-feeling">Sinking Feeling</a>. Meta origami tends to focus on cranes or flat sheets, but there are so many recognizable forms in origami, like the paper plane. Here, I have a pilot with a scarf flying a paper plane. </p>
<p>I folded a lot of paper planes as a kid, so I think I would have been excited to know that I could not only design a plane with a pilot, but it actually flies.</p>
<p>I should really refold this and take a better photo. The whole thing was rushed because I was trying to force myself back into designing after an 8 month hiatus.</p>

    <title>Ship in a Bottle</title>
    <url>/ship-in-a-bottle/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have been holding onto this idea for over a year now. I saw someone put a paper boat in a plastic bottle as a way to do an origami ship in a bottle, but I thought it could be done better. The bottle and ship should be from the same sheet, and the paper should be opaque. </p>
<p>This is one of my most recognizable subjects, despite the fact that it’s not even a full bottle. If anyone ever asks how storytelling feeds into my origami, I always point to this, because so much of storytelling is finding exactly which details are necessary to communicate an idea. </p>
<p>This was my qualifier round entry for the 2025 Death Battle Design Contest. </p>

    <title>Stargazing</title>
    <url>/stargazing/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>We are the universe observing itself.</p>
<p>Origami is the perfect medium for this idea, because both the observer and the universe can be made from the same sheet, completely connected. Here, the observer is the telescope, and the universe is the night sky with a single star visible. The telescope is modeled after my own personal telescope, so I had a lot of fun combining a separate passion of mine with origami.</p>

    <title>Trophy Hunting</title>
    <url>/trophy-hunting/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>What started as a sketch of an elephant head turned into something much more. Trophy hunting as a broader concept is a contentious subject with a lot of philosophical nuance. In recent years, trophy hunting has become a trolley problem, where conservationists are offered millions to let trophy hunters kill a single animal. In exchange, that money could go to protecting many more of the same species. Is sacrificing one life worth saving others? Are we playing god with the natural world? I don’t have the answers.</p>

    <title>Waiting, Act I</title>
    <url>/waiting-act-i/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><em>Waiting</em> tells a story in two parts. In this first part, someone is waiting on a bench, holding a paper boat. The <a href="../waiting-act-ii">second act</a> reveals whom the subject is waiting for: a family of ducks. </p>
<p>Both designs incorporate identical benches. The goal here was to use the repeatability of origami to create a bench that was so similar in both settings, the viewer would be forgiven for thinking it was the same bench. In fact, neither the person nor the ducks can be detached from the bench. Both works are from single squares of paper.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to interpret these works, whether from the lens of reduced conservationism, deprioritizing the outdoors, or being in the right place at the wrong time. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The 2020s has seen a sharp increase in using “red flags” to discuss partners and dating, so I decided to take a more literal interpretation of the phrase.

    <title>About Ronik</title>
    <url>/about/index.html</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ronik Bhaskar is a Chicago-based origami artist who uses paper folding as a way to tell stories. Rather than focusing solely on technical complexity or realism, his work is built around ideas. Each piece starts with a concept, theme, or narrative he wants to communicate.</p>
<p>Working from a single sheet of paper, Ronik designs original models that explore humor, metaphor, and everyday experiences. A finished piece might combine multiple elements in a single composition or reinterpret a familiar object in an unexpected way. The goal is to tell a story beyond the recognizable form.</p>
<p>Constraints are central to his process. Great stories are told not just in the details they include, but the ones they exclude. By limiting his work to folded, uncut squares, Ronik finds the essential components to tell his stories. Through his work, Ronik approaches origami not just as a craft, but as a medium for visual storytelling, one sheet of paper at a time.</p>
